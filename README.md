# WeChat

This assignment aims to help you understand and practice React

## Objectives

## TODO

### Run Starter Code

### Re-implement WeChat

- In your WeChat, the user should be able to
  - send messages
  - edit messages
  - delete messages
  - view profile
  - select and message a specific friend from contact list
- Your WeChat is client-side only, meaning you are not required to communicate with a server to store data. All data is fake (generated by [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)) and stored locally
